# check-grid
To do list in a grid format with auto-tagging and auto-assignment

## Why build another to-do app?
A to-do application serves as a good tutorial or first project for early-stage developers, such as myself. To-do lists are also useful for people from all industries and backgrounds.

## How will check-grid be different?
We aim to make check-grid the most automated to-do application ever. The user should only type in the task. The tagging, labeling, time-tracking, and assigning are all done automatically using machine learning models. Users will be able to correct the tags or labels after creating a task, but the goal is to remove the user from having to do any of the additional labeling work.

## Made by data scientists for data scientists
This is a pet project by a team of data scientists. If you are interested in downloading your data with labels for your own use, you will be able to do so.

## Data Protection and Privacy
The data collected by the application will be aggregated to improve our models. Any personally identifiable information will be removed in the process. **Personal data** will not be sold or sent to any third-party organizations. This policy will extend to any developers who wish to use the API for their application.

#### Disclaimer
We may explore integrations with other established AI products, which may include sharing the anonymized training data with other platforms. For users who wish keep their data completely private, we hope include a paid option in the future.
