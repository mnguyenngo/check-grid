# to-do-grid
To do list in a grid format with auto-tagging and auto-assignment

## Why build another to-do app?
A to-do application serves as a good tutorial or first project for early-stage developers, such as myself. To-do lists are also useful for people from all industries and backgrounds.

## How will to-do-grid (tdg) be different?
We aim to make tdg the most automated to-do application ever. The user should only type in the task. The tagging, labeling, time-tracking, and assigning are all done automatically using machine learning models. Users will be able to correct the tags or labels after creating a task, but the goal is to remove the user from having to do any of the additional labeling work.

## Mady by data scientists for data scientists
This is a pet project by a team of data scientists. If you are interested in downloading your data with labels for your own use, you will be able to do so. All data collected by the application will only be used to improve our own models and will not be sold or sent to any third-party organizations.
